Chromium Updater Extension
==========================
Chromium Extension to check for, download and install the latest Chromium revisions  

Mac OSX only for the moment  
Linux / Windows support coming up

--
Safest to install from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromium-updater/ccgjmadhdidfloacagcnnodbkedkjedg)


For manual install, go to `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer Mode at the top, click 'Load unpacked extension' and load the folder contents. Auto Updates won't work when installed this way. 


Mac builds from FreeSMUG.org,  
Linux / Windows builds from woolyss.com (not yet supported)
